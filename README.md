Bato-yo-slaget (Battleship)
==========

A python implimentation of the classic battleship game.

## History

Basic logic inited on [@JBKahn](https://github.com/JBKahn/Battleship) code.

Features that I liked:

- board size is a variable
- amount of cpu players defined in runtime
- user ships can be placed on the board randomly
- simple console output
