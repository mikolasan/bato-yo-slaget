Bato-yo-slaget (Battleship)
==========

A python implimentation of the classic battleship game.

## History

Basic logic inited on **@JBKahn** [code](https://github.com/JBKahn/Battleship).

Features that I liked:

- board size is a variable
- amount of cpu players defined in runtime
- user ships can be placed on the board randomly
- simple console output

From **@tmac-balla** I've taken [code](https://github.com/tmac-balla/battleship-game) to provide visualisation of game logic on PyGame library.
